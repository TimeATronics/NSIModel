N agents.

Bounded Confidence + :
Each agent has a position (opinion)
Each agent knows the mean position and standard deviation of positions
Each agent has a distinctiveness preference (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...) (may change after sufficient time)

Each agent corrects its position through a position adjustment rule (0 < k < 1)

(Do not consider negative influence in BCM or tolerance values, since we are dealing with
conformity and not consensus, which does not provide space for dissent or informed agreement.)

NSI modifications:

deal with the distinctiveness.

Each agent will know the average delta of its n neighbors (and distant neighbors, later)
after each time step, the delta will be modified to get closer to the average, linearly, finally leading to consensus

If every agent has same delta, then convergence to conformity occurs.
With sufficiently heterogenous delta values, divergence may occur. (not covered in NSI)

MODIFICATIONS:
1. dissenters (randomly interspersed, can work with negative influence)
2. personal tolerance
